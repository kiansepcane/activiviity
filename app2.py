        Data warehousing involves the process of collecting, storing, and managing large volumes of data 
        from different sources into a central repository for analytical reporting and decision-making. 
        Data warehouses provide a unified and consistent view of data, which allows businesses to derive 
        insights for strategic planning and operational efficiency.

        A data warehouse typically stores historical data and enables users to run complex queries and 
        generate reports. It is optimized for analytical processing, and data is typically loaded in batches. 
        Popular data warehousing tools include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.

        ETL tools extract data from source systems, perform necessary transformations (such as data cleaning,
