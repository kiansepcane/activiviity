In this code, I created a simple app where users can enter their name and age. I used Streamlit to make the app interactive. First, I added a title at the top of the page using st.title(), then I included a header with st.header() to introduce the section where users can input their details. I used st.text_input() for the user to type their name and st.number_input() to let them enter their age, with age restricted between 1 and 100.

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, I used st.write() to display a message that greets the user and shows their name and age. This makes the app feel interactive because the message updates based on the input provided. The button triggers the action to show the result when clicked.

This app is a great example of how easy it is to build interactive apps with Streamlit. I was able to quickly create an interface for input and output without needing to dive deep into more complex web development techniques.
