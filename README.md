In this code, I created a Streamlit app focused on data warehousing and enterprise data management topics. The app allows users to select a specific topic from a sidebar, such as "Data Warehousing," "ETL Processes," "Data Governance," "Data Modeling," or "Enterprise Data Management." Based on the selected topic, the app displays an overview of the topic along with additional detailed information. I used st.sidebar.selectbox() for topic selection and st.tabs() to organize the content into tabs, where the first tab shows detailed explanations, and the second tab offers additional resources.

For each topic, I included a brief description and an expandable section with further details, which users can access by clicking on the "Learn more" expander. The app also provides links to external resources for users who want to dive deeper into each topic. Lastly, the footer is a simple acknowledgment that the app was created using Streamlit. This app is useful for anyone looking to understand key concepts in data management and related fields.
