explanation
In this code, I created an interactive NBA stats dashboard using Streamlit that allows users to select a basketball player from a predefined list and view their statistics. The data for each player, including points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals, is displayed in both textual and visual formats. The user can choose a player from the sidebar, and the dashboard will show relevant statistics for that player. The data is presented through different types of visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and area charts, using both Matplotlib and Plotly.

The app first sets up the basic layout with a title and sidebar for the player selection. Once a player is chosen, it fetches the player’s stats from a mock dataset and displays the stats in text format. Then, it creates various charts to visually represent the player's performance. These charts are dynamically generated for each selected player, offering a detailed and interactive experience for users to explore the stats in different visual forms. This dashboard helps users easily compare the performance of different NBA players through graphical representations of their key statistics.
